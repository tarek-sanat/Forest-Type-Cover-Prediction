# Forest-Type-Cover-Prediction
Use of Supervised Machine Learning algorithms on a dataset with the goal of predicting the type of trees that grow in an area. The Sklearn library was used for this project.

## Description

This project uses a dataset from Kaggle that can be found here: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction)


* Performed Data Cleaning and feature analysis on the dataset, the goal was to deal with any duplicates or missing variables in the datasets. Some features were also omitted from the dataset due to them not helping with the prediction.

* Applied data visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots and heatmaps using the Matplotlib library on the categorical and continuous features of the dataset to observe different trends in the dataset.

* Used various Machine Learning algorithms to predict the correct Cover type. Algorithms such as K-nearest Neighbor, Random Forest Classifier and Naive Bayes were used. An accuracy of 88% was reached for the best model using Random forest classifier.

## Technologies Used
* This project was built using Python. The Sklearn library was used since it provides various machine learning algorithms that could be used to make the predictions.
Pandas and Matplotlib libraries were used throughout the project to work with the datasets and visualize some features.
